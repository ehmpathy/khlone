fulfill the objective of khlone that we started from in the original vision back in summer 2025 
- orchestration of brains enrolled with distilled roles

this is the original objective of separation between rhachet and khlone
- rhachet enables durable, portable, reliable enrollment -> unlocks delegation
- khlone enables observable, scalable dispatch and collaboration -> unlocks orchestration


---


the purpose of knlone is to orchestrate clones

clone = enrolled brain; an actor, enrolled with a role via rhachet

---

rhachet is a tool which enables the portable & durable enrollment of any role onto any brain (briefs and skills)

its purpose is to make robot development as testable, composable, portable, durable, and maintainable as classic software
- externalize knowledge => briefs, that flavor brains
- externalize abilities => skills, that enable brains
- decompose & recompose => briefs & skills compose and build on eachother, just like classic software
- durable => briefs & skills durably bind a brain to the role (like a ratchet locks into place), with provable durability
- portable => any role can be durably enrolled onto any brain; reuse just like any opensource software 
- maintainable => the decomposition of portable, durable roles enables architectural design and testcoverage just like classic software; slipless ratcheted improvement against targets is simple to achieve; zoomin via decomposition to tune any subcomponents, as usual; abstract to simplify contracts and bound away complexity, etc

rhachet is a tool which supplies the primitives of enrollemnt
- roles (role.briefs & role.skills)
- brains (brain.atoms, brain.repls, brain.clis, brain.hooks, brain.privs, etc)
- creds (keyrack)

with these privmitives, you can durably strap-down a role onto a brain, to make the brain operate as that given role
- this enables the durable and reliable adherance of knowledge and behavior of a brain
- with these externalized roles

in rhachet terms, an enrolled brain = an actor
- not yet delegated to, so has no agency
- but capable of action abound by its brain and role

then, rhachet layers on the creds management role with keyrack, to make it easy to portably and securely grant credentials as keys to these actors

rhachet's goal is to drop the bar to delegation
- externalized roles = repeatable and iteratively improvable yield from the actors 
  - briefs and skills externalize knowledge and capacity
  - this externalized knowledge and capacity can be portably and durably attached to any brain
  - =>
  - enables us to trust any brain to fulfill capabilities externalized within its role

- externalized roles = composable and evolvable 
  - just like software builds on sub-operations, skills and briefs build on subskills and subbriefs
  - unlocks reuse and hierarchial recomposition to solve any capacity

- secure, portable keyrack = the interface to grant delegation authority via
  - skills can leverage keyrack directly, omitting the need for actors to use keys directly
  - keyrack is portable for local and cloud zone invocation, eliminating the need for remote -vs- local differences for actor creds


rhachet also formalizes terms for many of the fundamental concepts that are required to work with robot actors
- skill thought routes (solid, rigid, fluid)
- continuity (brain.series, .episodes, .exchanges)
- brain.atom,.repl,.cli ; .hooks,.briefs
- the concepts of brain vs role themselves
- the concept of human vs robot; all of these terms apply to both humans and robots; humans are enrolled all the time. the same roles (briefs & skills) that are distilled via rhachet for robots are very very appliable and often reused by humans directly too
- the concept of agent vs actor; agents are just actors who have been delegated authority; humans and robots are both either actors or agents, dependent on their authority. (a doctor on tv is an actor of role doctor, zero delegated authority for that role; a doctor in a hospital is an agent of role doctor, real delegated authority for that role). (you can see how the two levels of actor vs agent require different depths of role doctor, too. role:doctor from repo theater-school is less useful than role:doctor from repo world-renoun-residency-program; etc)
- etc


so, in short. rhachet builds the primitives upon which delegation can be built

and delegation is indeed built through it, via skills like <route.drive>, which enable the actors to drive themselves along a thought route ; go through all of the required steps to success, self-review, peer-review, and then push-propose 

this solves the delegation layer,

which brings us to khlone

---

now that rhachet has enabled us to enroll brains into actors that we can trust to delegate work to

we want to do that without the constraints of a local machine

portable dispatch to delegates 

observable dispatch to delegates

seamless transition betweel local and cloud

---

specifically, 

- a delegate is a clone to whom someone has delegated authority (a.k.a. agent with a bounded authority on behalf of SOMEONE)
- a clone is an enrolled brain; (what rhachet calls an actor); we call it a clone, because each actor is fundamentally equivalent. if you take the same brain with the same role, they are clones of eachother. the only differences between them are their experiences (i.e., their continuitiy series); we distinguish from actor, because in khlones context, we deal with many actors of the same role, rather than just one ; 
- and the concept of brain, role, agent we already established above in the rhachet section

---

as usual, our goal is to bind the terms used for khlone to their nearest oldest human domains, so that we can leverage the polished and innate knowledge from those terms (and their symmetries in usage)

specifically, construction has been chosen as the domain of choice here, because of how diverse and complex the collaborative requirements are for agents who work in construction; 

their roles span an incredible breadth of domains; the coordination requirements are no less incredible

so, if the words are good enough for them, they'll have a lot of juice to lever for us - and keep us constrained to concepts that can withstand the pressures of reality.

---


we've already distilled a lot of our thoughts on what and why and how of khlone in priors priors 

specifically, for the first step, here 
- .behavior/v2026_02_15.khlone-v0/priors/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/1.vision.md (and the rest of the .behavior/v2026_02_15.khlone-v0/priors/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite dir)

with the big picture here
- .behavior/v2026_02_15.khlone-v0/priors/v2026_02_10.remote-compute/1.vision.v3.md
- .behavior/v2026_02_15.khlone-v0/priors/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/1.vision.v3.z1.valuechain.v1.i1.md

also included in the priors/ is the remote-compute behavior thread which prioritized this development of rhachet, how that we've had too many cases of local brain-clis making our terminals lag 


---

so, our wish here, is 

1. lets get the v0 vision distilled and defined, as formalized in .behavior/v2026_02_15.khlone-v0/priors/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/1.vision.md

lets rearticulate it

do comprehensive re-research on the briefs that power them and collect them as knowledge into .agent/repo=.this/role=any/briefs (for reuse)

and lets get the first stage released!
